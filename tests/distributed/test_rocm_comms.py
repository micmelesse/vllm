"""Does each communicator backend work?

One test per (backend, mode). `exercise` puts ONE communicator through the whole API --
both collectives, both dtypes, every shape -- because that is what vLLM does. Every cell
is four steps: gen_inputs -> run_collective -> expected_outputs -> compare.

The modes localise a failure rather than covering different ground: `eager` asks whether
the collective is right at all, `graph` whether capture/replay preserves that across
many replays with fresh input, `vllm` whether the real pattern works: a collective per
layer, EVERY shape captured together under one registration -- vLLM's capture-size
ladder, sharing one set of buffers -- replayed round-robin, with an eager fallback in
the middle.
