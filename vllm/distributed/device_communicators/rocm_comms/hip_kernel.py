"""Python interface to our HIP collectives, and the only place they are TUNED.

Two files, both ours: this and `hip_comms.cu`. `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load` compiles
the `.cu` with hipcc and caches the `.so`, so there is no build system, no entry in no
CMake entry and nothing in vLLM's `csrc`.

THE SPLIT. The `.cu` is mechanism and holds no policy; every decision -- which
algorithm, how many blocks, how many threads -- is made here, by `config_for`, and
passed down. Same shape as a Triton kernel with `@triton.autotune`: the kernel body has
no heuristics and the meta-parameters are chosen outside it. Two consequences worth
knowing:

- A tuning decision is a pure Python function, so it is testable without a GPU. A `if
(size < N)` in the `.cu` would be a decision nobody can see, and the env var it
eventually grows is how you end up with `VLLM_CUSTOM_ALLREDUCE_ALGO`.
- It costs nothing where it matters. vLLM captures cudagraphs, so `config_for` runs ONCE
during capture and replay is pure kernel launch with no Python at all.

`ngpus` and the dtype have to be compile-time to unroll and vectorize, so they select a
template instantiation rather than being passed; the `.cu`'s dispatch names every
combination that exists and REFUSES anything else rather than substituting.

Two environment knobs, both set by the arm's Dockerfile rather than defaulted here:
`TORCH_EXTENSIONS_DIR` (where the `.so` is cached; must be an image path, not the
mounted `~/.cache`) and `PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH` (which torch turns into `--offload-arch`;
required when warming the build with no GPU present to detect).
